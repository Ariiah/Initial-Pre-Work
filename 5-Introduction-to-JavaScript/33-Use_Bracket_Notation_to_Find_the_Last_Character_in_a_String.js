// To prevent from counting or guessing how many charcters it takes to reach the last character in a string, it can be done by using braket notation and finding the length of the string -1.

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var lastLetterOfFirstName = firstName[firstName.length - 1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length-1];
