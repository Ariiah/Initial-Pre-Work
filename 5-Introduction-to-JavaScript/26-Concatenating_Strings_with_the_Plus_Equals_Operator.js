// String concatenation also works by assigning the previous variable and using the += operator to attach another sentence.

// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the first sentence. " ;
myStr += "This is the second sentence."
