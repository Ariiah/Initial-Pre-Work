// camelCase is best practice when declaring Javascript variables. It makes for clearer understanding, especially when HTML and CSS are mixed into the same file.

// Declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;
