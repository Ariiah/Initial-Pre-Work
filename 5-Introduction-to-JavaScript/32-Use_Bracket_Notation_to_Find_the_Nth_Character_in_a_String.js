// Starting from 0, you can find which characters are at which indexes. Although, if the index is larger than the amount of characters, it will throw an undefined.

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];
