// If there is nothing assigned to a variable, the code will throw an undefined error. Even when the variable is reassigned to add more data, it takes the previous declaration, and if there is no data to pull from, the undefined error will still be thrown.

// Initialize these three variables
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";

// Do not change code below this line

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";
