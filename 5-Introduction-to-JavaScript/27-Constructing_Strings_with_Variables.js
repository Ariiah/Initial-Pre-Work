// Sometimes a variable will need to be insterted into the string, and that can also be done through concatenating it into the new string.

// Example
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "Kelly";
var myStr = "My name is" + myName + " and I am well!";
