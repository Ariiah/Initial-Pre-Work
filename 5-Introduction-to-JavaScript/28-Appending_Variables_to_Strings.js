// Concatenating strings via variables can also be added, or appended, together as well.

// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective = "a journey." ;
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;
